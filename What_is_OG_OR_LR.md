REMARK: I have my computer language settings set to BASQUE language. Therefore, when I create a plot based on weekdays, 
the short names I get are different from those existing in English.
That's why in my PNG files OG appears (short for OsteGuna, i.e. Thursday in Basque language), 
OR (short for OstiRala, i.e. Friday) and LR (short for LarunBata, i.e. Saturday).
